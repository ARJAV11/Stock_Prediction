# Description
The Stock Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based financial forecasting system that employs a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network architecture to predict stock prices. The goal of this project is to leverage historical stock market data to create an accurate and reliable model that can forecast future price movements for various stocks.

# Key Components:
* Data Preprocessing: The project starts with collecting historical stock market data, including open, high, low, and closing prices, as well as trading 
 volumes. Data preprocessing techniques are applied to handle missing values, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
* LSTM Model Design: The heart of the project lies in designing the LSTM neural network. The LSTM model is chosen due to its ability to capture long-term 
 dependencies and patterns in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks.
* Training and Validation: The LSTM model is trained on a portion of th
* e historical data and validated on a separate set to avoid overfitting. Training and  
 validation processes iteratively adjust the model's parameters to minimize prediction errors.
* Stock Price Forecasting: Once the LSTM model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed to forecast future stock price movements based on the latest 
 available historical data. The model can provide insights into potential market trends and assist in making informed financial decisions.
